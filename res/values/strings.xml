        <b>Rune of change</b>
    </string>
    <string name="ehwaz_up">
		<b>Rune of change. The movement of progress. </b>\n\n
This is the Rune of teamwork, harmony and cooperation.  
This unity of work and ideal does not require the sacrifice of individuality.  
It can portend a time of transition and physical shifts.  
Steady growth and development slowly grow into rich accomplishments.  
Face the future with confident expectation that all will be well.  
This Rune can represent a partner, either in business or in romance.

    <string name="ehwaz_down">
    	<b>Rune obstacles</b>\n\n
There is a danger of losing yourself in your partner.  
A blockage in the force embodied by Ehwaz can result in disharmony, 
separation, divorce and betrayal.

	</string>
    <string name="uruz_up">
        <b>Rune of the new form</b>\n\n
       This is the energy of the Primal Source, the original procreation.  
       It symbolizes growth and transformation.  
       The life you have been living is due for major change.  
       This is not a Rune of ending, but is instead a Rune of new beginnings.  
       There may be darkness, but it is that of a tunnel leading to a new life. 
        The light will be brighter at the end.  
        Prepare for an opportunity disguised as a loss.

        <b>Rune disorganization Force</b>
		
	</string>
    <string name="uruz_down">
        <b>Rune disorganization Force</b>\n\n
        Could indicate over-protectiveness or possessiveness, 
        or the misuse of strength or power.  
        You may fail to take advantage of the moment.  
        It is possible that your strength may seem to be used against you.  
        The seeming failure may come as a minor or major jolt, 
        depending on your awareness.   Remember, 
        life is a cycle and you will again reach this 
        point to again have this choice.

	</string>
        <string name="gebo">
        <b>Rune partnership</b>\n\n
        Be prepared to be generous, and to accept the generosity of others.  
        You may receive spiritual or a material gift, or the gift of another’s heart.   
        If a union is at hand, keep part of yourself separate.  
        You should both maintain your own identities.  
        It can represent someone in a service industry, 
        or someone who works for a charitable or ecological organization.
        Negative aspects of the Rune, however, 
        may include a tendency toward being a spendthrift, 
        wasting your material or spiritual resources.  
        It can symbolize the disruption of a family or a friendship.

	<string name="hagalaz_wd">
		<b>Rune complete break</b>
		
	</string>
	<string name="hagalaz">
        <b>Rune complete break</b>\n\n
        There is a need to break free from constraints, 
        and prepare for a change in your life or your situation.  
        There are some things beyond your control, and 
        there may be strife and turmoil coming into your life.  
        It signals a need to re-focus your life, aligning it with mythic models.  
        Though this Rune has only an upright position, 
        it operates through reversal.  
        You may feel as though you are waking from a 
        long sleep and take some time to come to your full senses.  
        There may be a loss before there is a great gain.  
        This Rune may symbolize a magician, sorcerer, 
        mystic, witch, mage or priest.
        Negative aspect can indicate the potential of a change for the worse.  
        This can, however, be averted by preparation and planning.  
        While crisis may not be totally avoided, it can be controlled.

	    <b>Rune of protection</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="algiz_up">
        <b>Rune of protection</b>\n\n
        This Rune is a two-edged sword, and can bode danger 
        for anyone other than an experienced or gifted Vitki, or Rune Mage.   
        One should not try to grasp this sword, but to become one with it.  
        Brains, not brawn, will serve you well in problems faced at this time.  
        This Rune generally does not signify persons, 
        but rather divine or spiritual beings and/or forces. 
         It can foretell an awakening of craft and cunning in the individual.
    </string>
	<string name="algiz_down_wd">
	    <b>Rune of flexibility</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="algiz_down">
        <b>Rune of flexibility</b>\n\n
        There may be hidden danger waiting to ensnare you.  
        Hasty and ill-considered actions will plunge you into serious problems.  
        There is the danger of being swallowed up by archetypal forces, 
        which you think to shape to your will with inadequate knowledge or preparation.  
        This can result in damage to both spiritual and physical health.

	    <b>Rune of a way</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="raido_up">
        <b>Rune of a way</b>\n\n
		This may portend a journey, either physical or spiritual, 
		or it may signal a change in a relationship or your domestic situation.   
		It can symbolize a person in the fields of law 
		and justice on one hand, or travel and transportation on the other.   
		Justice can be expected, but remember that 
		we are not intended to rely on our power alone.  
		Ask guidance from the Divine, and know that you will be led to the right action.         
    </string>
	<string name="raido_down_wd">
	    <b>Rune of surprises</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="raido_down">
        <b>Rune of surprises</b>\n\n
		This can bode suffering and hard times.  
		Personal relationships are threatened now.  
		Break-ups may be more plentiful than unions, 
		but remember, even failures may 
		be opportunities in disguise.       
    </string>
	<string name="nauthiz_up_wd">
	    <b>Rune of retardation</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="nauthiz_up">
        <b>Rune of retardation</b>\n\n
		There is stress, but it can be turned into strength.  
		Restraint is called for.  
		There will be holdups, and the need to 
		reconsider your plans carefully.   
		Original thought, creativity and 
		self-reliance could see you through a difficult time.   
		Try to restore harmony in your life,
		 but if you cannot, at least strive for balance.  
		 There is an indication of extreme passion 
		 in a love affair (torrid romance or major crisis.)  
		 This Rune can symbolize a menial worker, 
		 a laborer or farmer, or it can stand for a magician or mage.        
    </string>
	<string name="nauthiz_down_wd">
	    <b>Rune of inner evil</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="nauthiz_down">
        <b>Rune of inner evil</b>\n\n
		External circumstances are shaping our present situation 
		in ways over which we have no control.  
		We may face pain and hardship, 
		but this can be a source of strength and knowledge.  
		Friction within ourselves, our families, 
		our coworkers may create stress, 
		but cleansing can help to strengthen the character.   
		There will be a temptation to take the easy way out 
		of a stressful situation, but this will be 
		a major mistake, leading to a weakening of one’s character.         
    </string>
	<string name="wunjo_up_wd">
	    <b>Rune of joy</b>  
	    
	</string>
	<string name="wunjo_up">
        <b>Rune of joy</b>\n\n
		This Rune promises harmony, (personal, domestic and social.) 
		Physical health is either promised, or needs to be attended to.   
		This is a time for new friendships and social (non-sexual) relationships.  
		This may be a time for you to reap the harvest of earlier efforts.  
		Knowledge matures into understanding.  
		Through new clarity existing ambitions, goals or plans may be seen 
		as less desirable than they appeared with a more limited understanding.
    </string>
	<string name="wunjo_down_wd">
	    <b>Rune of crisis</b> 
	    
	</string>
	<string name="wunjo_down">
        <b>Rune of crisis</b>\n\n
		It would be easy to lose your own identity 
		into that of a gestalt, or group mind.  
		A difficult time is at hand. 
		There is light mixed with the dark, 
		good with the ill, but it may be difficult 
		to discern between them.  Poor relationships, 
		strife and alienation, may be forthcoming.       
    </string>
	<string name="kano_up_wd">
	    <b>Rune of clarity</b>  
	      
	</string>
	<string name="kano_up">
        <b>Rune of renewed clarity</b>\n\n
		This is the Rune of creation, symbolizing light breaking through to dispel the clouds.   
		It is the fire of inspiration and creativity, of the hearth, the forge and the altar.  
		This Rune can symbolize an artist, or crafts person.  
		Through awareness of the fire’s light, understanding comes 
		to you and enables you to spread light and understanding to others.  
		This can portend a change, a transformation, perhaps a child.
    </string>
	<string name="kano_down_wd">
	    <b>Rune of defilements</b> 
	   
	</string>
	<string name="kano_down">
        <b>Rune of defilements</b>\n\n
		Clouds are now beginning to cover the sun.  
		A partnership or love affair may be ending.  
		Give up the old gladly, so that the new can be welcomed.  
    </string>
	<string name="isa_wd">
	    <b>Rune of stagnation</b> 
	   
	</string>
	<string name="isa">
        <b>Rune of stagnation</b>\n\n
		Winter has come upon you, chilling your spirit.  
		Difficult situations must be managed through your 
		own inner resources, since you can expect no 
		help from outside yourself.  
		You seem to be in stasis, locked in ice, 
		and unable to move. Any major accomplishment is unlikely now.   
		Concentrate on keeping up, not trying to get ahead.   
		There may be some outdated habit or idea that 
		you need to relinquish, so that the thaw will follow.  
		This Rune may symbolize a rogue, a mystic, a scoundrel, 
		a corpse, or the spirit of one already 
		crossed over into the Summerlands.
		Negative influences, however, 
		can be the weakening of the will, 
		or allowing one to be controlled by others, 
		dominated by outside influences or forces.  
		You may be blinded to the totality of all that 
		is going on in your life, concentrating on 
		trifles and ignoring the more urgent and significant problems.
    </string>
	<string name="jera_wd">
	    <b>Rune of a favorable outcome</b>
	   
	</string>
	<string name="jera">
        <b>Rune of a favorable outcome</b>\n\n
		Beneficial rewards will be the result of 
		whatever endeavor you have undertaken in love and honor.  
		Justice will prevail, and virtue will be rewarded.   
		Have patience, however, since it may take time for results to appear.  
		A span of time is always involved.   
		No farmer can rush his harvest by tugging on the young shoots.   
		This Rune can symbolize a farmer, or someone involved 
		in finance (a banker, stockbroker, etc.)
		Negative aspects can include bad results from bad deeds 
		(the other side of the coin of “Justice.”)  
		There may be a tendency to be enslaved by routine, trapped in old habits.

	<string name="perth_up_wd">
	    <b>Rune of search</b> 
	   
	</string>
	<string name="perth_up">
        <b>Rune of search</b>\n\n
	This Rune promises joyful changes and good surprises.  
	This is a lucky Rune to draw, since it portends joy and harmony.  
	It portends good fellowship and happiness, 
	akin to the “gemütlicheit” of the German beer halls.  
	It may represent an entertainer, a musician, or a bard.        
    </string>
	<string name="perth_down_wd">
	    <b>Rune of death last</b>

	<string name="perth_down">
        <b>Rune of death last</b>\n\n
	Do not expect too much right now, and do not 
	allow yourself to become addicted to the pleasures of the senses.  
	Unwise use can lead to squandering your resources and gifts, 
	while a blockage leads to stultification and stagnation.

	</string>
	<string name="fehu_up">
		<b>Rune of the acquisition or retention</b>\n\n
		Symbol of mobile power, or readily accessible assets.  
		Clearly define your desire, and carefully seek foresight and wisdom.   
		This could signify wealth and possessions, 
		or self-rule and the growth of will.   
		Enjoy good fortune if you now have it, 
		but remember to share it, for only by 
		nourishing others can you be truly nourished       
    </string>

	</string>
	<string name="fehu_down">
        <b>Rune of alienation</b>\n\n
		Obsession with material possessions can develop 
		into greed and avarice, resulting in 
		alienation from society or from your inner self.  
		Your arrows repeatedly miss the target. 
		Observe the situation, and ask, 
		"What do I need to learn to further my progress?"  
		Control your energies and resources, using them with wisdom.

	<string name="ansuz_up">
        <b>Rune of obtain</b>\n\n
		This is the sovereign divine conscious power of the god Ódhinn.  
		It can symbolize new life and inspiration, or promise intellectual 
		gifts or the linguistic gifts of oratory or poetry.  
		This Rune can symbolize a teacher or a priest. 
		A connection with the Divine, or the inner self, may be at hand.

	<string name="ansuz_down">
        <b>Rune of futility</b>\n\n
		Be aware during meetings with others.  
		Poor communication may lead to delusion.  
		Remember, what happens now is timely to your development.   
		Danger may come from unwholesome influences 
		or the misuse of your own knowledge or gifts.  
		Boredom or the death of the intellect may result from misuse.

	<string name="mannaz_up">
        <b>Rune of own "I"</b>\n\n
		This is the Rune of Mankind, standing in all his glory, warts and all.  
		It stands for nobility and depravity, charity and cruelty.  
		In short, it stands for Man.  It can portend a newfound clarity of vision, 
		and a willingness to change is effective now.  
		It can stand for a new awakening into the light of your higher self.  
		Become right with yourself first, then you can get right with others.  
		While this Rune can represent any human being at all, 
		it most often stands for a seeker after wisdom.

	</string>
	<string name="mannaz_down">
        <b>Rune of internal enemy</b>\n\n
		There is a tendency to dwell on the failures 
		of mankind in general, and yourself in particular.  
		Do not be overly critical of yourself or of others.  
		If there is blockage now, it comes from within.  
		Look to yourself, not to others at this time.  
		Stop and reconsider.   
		The outer enemy is but a reflection of you.  
		Do not lose yourself in delusion, 
		or dwell in fantasy rather than reality.

	<string name="berkana_up">
        <b>Rune of growth</b>\n\n
This is a Rune which promises prosperity, 
fertility, productivity and beauty.  
It may portend new elements of excitement being introduced 
into a romantic or erotic relationship.  
Look for tranquil growth and spiritual development within 
the framework of tradition.  It represents the “Divine Feminine,” 
the female force.  Thus, it can represent a virgin, a mother 
or a whore.  It stands for all the complexities of the Maiden, 
the Mother and the Crone.

	<string name="teivaz_up">
        <b>Rune of formation</b>\n\n
	This is the Rune of faith, truth, trust, 
	loyalty and devotion, summed up by the old word “troth.” 
	 You can expect justice, especially 
	 if you base your actions on well thought out plans.  
	 The path to enlightenment may lead through self-sacrifice.  
	 If you have dark corners, clean them out now.    
	 If you need help to cleanse the corners, seek an expert.  
	 Only then can the harvest ripen.  If you evidence “troth,” 
	 you can expect it in return.  This Rune may signify a scientist,

	<string name="sowelu">
        <b>Rune of integrity</b>\n\n
 What you strive to be, you already are.  
 You are receiving good counsel, 
 and this is a time for good hope.  
 It promises good fortune in any journey, 
 especially one over water.  
 This is the time for recharging and regenerating yourself.  
 If you must retreat from pressing situations, 
 make it a retreat in strength, not weakness.    
 Let the Sun illuminate the secrets you hid even from yourself.   
  This Rune may symbolize a sailor, a traveler or a teacher.
  Negative aspects, however, include a tendency to be easily 
  led by unworthy teachers, to accept illogical premises 
  only because they are presented pleasantly.  
  There is a danger of being misled.

This may be a time of dramatic changes.   
Trust your intuition and success will follow.  
Practice self-control, and strive for “Moderation in All Things.”  
There may be a feeling of being “out of control,” 
but do not fear your journey at this time.  
Immerse yourself in the experience of “being,” 
without trying to measure, evaluate or understand 
the mystical experiences you may have.  
Personal growth will come, even though through 
uncomfortable situations.

    <string name="inguz">
        <b>Rune of completion</b>\n\n
        Now is the time of great inner strength, rest, and internal growth.  
        This is a time to bring projects already started to completion 
        before beginning anything new.  
        Be patient, since projects and ideas are in a time of 
        deep gestation, and need inner stillness to grow to 
        maturity before the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis.  
        Movement may cause you to free yourself from a rut in your 
        life, but be cautious.  Avoid unnecessary turmoil.  
        This Rune may signify a priest or a farmer.
        In its negative aspect, 
        this Rune is the curse of many mystics, 
        those who become bottled up inside their own 
        subjective universes, losing contact with reality.   
        Self-absorption is a danger, along with the potential

   	It can also portend a new and better home,

 This is the sign of the “Day,” indicating a new awakening, 
 moving from the dark to the light.  While you can be confident 
 of the right outcome of major undertakings, 
 the outcome is not always predictable.  
  Seek the ideal, setting your standards at the highest level.  
  This portends growth, transformation and maturity.   
  If followed by the blank Rune, “Ódhinn’s Rune,” the 
  transformation may be so total as to portend a death, 
  a successful conclusion to your passage.  
  This Rune represents the true seeker.
  There is no inverse, and really no truly negative aspect.  
  The only danger is if the Rune comes to one who does not 
  want it, or who is not prepared for it.  
  Since the change or transformation is ultimately 
  beneficial, one should try to become prepared 
  for it, rather than fear it.

        <b>Руна Одина</b>\n\n
		This is the blank Rune, symbolizing the unknowable and the unseen.  
		This indicates a crucial time, a time when decisions must be made.  
		It may be time to take a great leap of faith, to leap 
		over the side of the cliff of doubt into the void of the unknown.  
		Do so with perfect love and perfect faith.  
		What beckons is the creative power of the unknown.  
		The void existed at the beginning of time and 
		will be there in the end, with nothing remaining.  
		This does not symbolize a person, but rather is 
		representative of the highest spiritual influences.
		 There is no inverse.  
		 The only danger from this Rune is that of fear of change.

    <string name="eihwaz">
		<b>Rune of delay</b>\n\n
This is the symbol of Yggdrasil, the world tree, 
with its roots in the earth and its branches in the heavens.  
It promises mental and spiritual growth and development.  
You may seem to be powerless, but you must be tough, 
disciplined and flexible.  Patience is called for, 
and waiting may be the most desirable action.    
Seek independence from the routine of your regular life, 
so that you may grow in diversity and wisdom.  
This Rune may symbolize a mage or a mystic.
There is no inverse, however the Rune may portend obstacles.   
Even they, however, may help us in our 
progress toward the light of inner wisdom.

		<b>Rune of the gate</b>\n\n
 		There is work to be done, both within yourself and without, 
 		however there is need for caution.  
 		Do not act impulsively, or without knowledge.  
 		Beware of the potential results of your words and deeds. 
 		Know that waiting may be just the right action to take.  
 		If you wait, remove resistance while waiting.  
 		You may be ready to contact the Divine, for this power 
 		can lead to evolution and regeneration.  
 		This is a strong erotic power, which can be channeled 
 		into other types of energy.  
 		You can now see that which is hidden inside, 
 		and know that in so doing, you will be doing the right action.

	<string name="thurisaz_down">
		<b>Rune of weakness</b>\n\n
		 This Rune can symbolize an enemy, or danger from the outside.  
		 Your progress may accelerate, but remember to pause for contemplation.   
		 Integrate the new.  
		 Do not act hastily now, or you may regret it.  
		 Temper your impulses through meditation.
